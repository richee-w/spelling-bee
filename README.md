## Spelling Bee

The following is a Python script that creates a word-processed RTF file that can be utilized in a word processor. The resulting file can be printed and employed for a spelling bee contest.

To generate the file, just type "./spell-test.py" and the RTF document "spelling_competition.rtf" will emerge in the same location as the "spell-test.py" file.
